Spot.Us is yours to shape (including your profile: http://spot.us/myspot/profile)

Our goal is to make sure that reporters cover the issues that are
important to you. The best way to make this happen is to....

1. Start a tip: This lets our reporters know what is important to you.

2. Fund a pitch: Perhaps our reporters have already created a pitch that
would be of interest to you. Your donation could turn it into a reality.

If you have any questions – don’t hesitate to contact Spot.Us: info@spot.us

We are very hands on and passionate about making sure that the
information needs of our communities are met. We work for you!!!!

Sincerely,
David Cohn
