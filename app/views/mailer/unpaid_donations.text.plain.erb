Dear <%=@user.first_name%>,

Hello from Spot.Us. We've noticed that you started the donation process to support one of our pitches, but never completed the process.

Completing your tax-deductible contribution is quick and simple. Just log into Spot.Us and go here: <%= edit_myspot_donations_amounts_path %>

With your support we can make sure that important, but overlooked stories are finally told.

Sincerely,

The Spot.Us Team
