In the meantime, here are some ideas on how to get started:

1. Start a pitch:  Traditionally you would pitch editors, because they
were the only people that had a freelance budget.  At Spot.Us community
members band together to build a budget of their own.  Now you can pitch
the public to do the journalism you want! 

Here are answers to some FAQ's

information needs of our communities are met.  We work for you!!!!
